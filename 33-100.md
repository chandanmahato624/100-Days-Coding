This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.


### 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\
Output: 6

#### Example 2:
Input: root = []\
Output: 0

#### Explanation:
Traversal each node and count++ after that return the number.

```
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void inorder(TreeNode* root, int &cnt){
        if(root == nullptr){
            return;
        }
        inorder(root->left, cnt);
        cnt++;
        inorder(root->right, cnt);
    }
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
       int cnt=0;
       inorder(root, cnt);
       return cnt; 
    }
};
```

### 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
#### Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\
Output: 3

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

#### Explanation:
Find the max depth between left node and right node after that +1 for root node then return.

/**

 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == nullptr){
            return 0;
        }
        int ans = max(maxDepth(root->left),maxDepth(root->right))+1;
        return ans;
    }
};
```
