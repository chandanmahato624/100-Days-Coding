This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### Smallest window containing 0, 1 and 2 GFG - PODT

#### Example 1:

Input:
S = 10212\
Output:
3\
Explanation:
The substring 102 is the smallest substring
that contains the characters 0, 1 and 2.


#### Example 2:
Input:
S = 12121\
Output:
-1\
Explanation: 
As the character 0 is not present in the
string S, therefor no substring containing
all the three characters 0, 1 and 2
exists. Hence, the answer is -1 in this case

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
----------------
```bash
  East level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
//{ Driver Code Starts
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


// } Driver Code Ends
// User function Template for C++

class Solution {
  public:
    int smallestSubstring(string s) {
        int mini = INT_MAX, x = -1, y = -1, z = -1, n = s.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(s[i] == '0')     
                x = i;
            else if(s[i] == '1')
                y = i;
            else if(s[i] == '2')
                z = i;
                
            if(x == -1 or y == -1 or z == -1)
                continue;
                
            int maxL = max({x, y, z});
            int minL = min({x, y, z});
            mini = min(mini, maxL - minL + 1);
        }
        
        return mini == INT_MAX ? -1 : mini;
    }
};


//{ Driver Code Starts.

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        string S;
        cin >> S;
        Solution ob;
        cout << ob.smallestSubstring(S);
        cout << endl;
    }
}
// } Driver Code Ends

### 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank

#### Example 1:

Input: bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]\
Output: 8\
Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]\
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.


#### Example 2:
Input: bank = ["000","111","000"]\
Output: 0\
Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
----------------
```bash
  Medium level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
    public int numberOfBeams(String[] bank) {
       int ans = 0, temp = 0;
        for (String str : bank) {
            int n = str.replaceAll("[^1]", "").length();
            if (n == 0) continue;
            ans += temp * n;
            temp = n;
        }
        return ans; 
    }
}
```
