This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 76. Minimum Window Substring -XXXXX

#### Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"\
Output: "BANC"\
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.


#### Example 2:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"\
Output: "a"\
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> map(128,0);
        for (char c : t) {
            map[c]++;
        }

        int counter = t.size(), begin = 0, end = 0, d = INT_MAX, head = 0;
        while (end < s.size()){
            if (map[s[end++]]-- > 0) {
                counter--;
            }
            while (counter == 0) {
                if (end - begin < d) {
                    head = begin;
                    d = end - head;
                }
                if (map[s[begin++]]++ == 0) {
                    counter++;
                }
            }  
        }
        return d == INT_MAX ? "" : s.substr(head, d);
    }
};
