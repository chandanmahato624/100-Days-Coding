This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.

```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
         vector<string> res;
        addingpar(res, "", n, 0);
        return res;
    }
    void addingpar(vector<string> &v, string str, int n, int m){
        if(n==0 && m==0) {
            v.push_back(str);
            return;
        }
        if(m > 0){ addingpar(v, str+")", n, m-1); }
        if(n > 0){ addingpar(v, str+"(", n-1, m+1); }
    }
};

### 198. House Robber -XXXXX

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]\
Output: 4\
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.


#### Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]\
Output: 12\
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& A) {
        if(size(A) == 1) return A[0];
        vector<int> dp(A);
        dp[1] = max(A[0], A[1]);
        for(int i = 2; i < size(A); i++)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], A[i] + dp[i-2]);
        return dp.back();
    }
};
