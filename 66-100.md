This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 2540. Minimum Common Value - PODT

#### Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]\
Output: 2\
Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.


#### Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]\
Output: 2\
Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Create two int variable and start both from 0 if nums1 is less then nums2 then i++ otherwise j++.
```bash
  Easy level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int getCommon(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n1 = nums1.size();
        int n2 = nums2.size();
        int i=0, j=0;
        while(i<n1 && j<n2){
            if(nums1[i]==nums2[j]) return nums1[i];
            else if(nums1[i]<nums2[j]) i++;
            else j++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
