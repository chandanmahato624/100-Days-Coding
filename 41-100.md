This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 661. Image Smoother = PODT

#### Example 1:

Input: img = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]\
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\
Explanation:
For the points (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2): floor(3/4) = floor(0.75) = 0\
For the points (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1): floor(5/6) = floor(0.83333333) = 0\
For the point (1,1): floor(8/9) = floor(0.88888889) = 0


#### Example 2:
Input: img = [[100,200,100],[200,50,200],[100,200,100]]\
Output: [[137,141,137],[141,138,141],[137,141,137]]\
Explanation:
For the points (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2): floor((100+200+200+50)/4) = floor(137.5) = 137\
For the points (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1): floor((200+200+50+200+100+100)/6) = floor(141.666667) = 141\
For the point (1,1): floor((50+200+200+200+200+100+100+100+100)/9) = floor(138.888889) = 138

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Its acually simple questions but leetcode explanation is not enough to understand the problem. \
Step1: Here first create a new 2d matrix to store updated values because if i use exiting matrix to store updated value then next time it will be crate problem for next value.\ 
Step2: In step 2 find the nghbrs value and aslo count how many nghbrs avalible in given range after that calculate the avarage value and store it on new matrix in correct possition.

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> directions{
        {-1, -1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, 1},
        {0, -1}, {0, 0}, {0, 1}, 
        {1, -1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}
    };
    vector<vector<int>> imageSmoother(vector<vector<int>>& img) {
        int m = img.size();
        int n = img[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
                int sum_nghbers = 0;
                int count_nghbrs = 0;
                for(auto &it: directions){
                    int i_ = i+it[0];
                    int j_ = j+it[1];
                    if(i_>=0 && i_<m && j_>=0 && j_<n){
                        sum_nghbers+=img[i_][j_];
                        count_nghbrs++;
                    }
                }
                result[i][j]=sum_nghbers/count_nghbrs;
            }
        }
        return result;

### 226. Invert Binary Tree

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]\
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,3]\
Output: [2,3,1]
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Using recursion it very much easy, first write base case after that call left funcation and right funcation and swap two node help of temp variable its same like swap in array.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==nullptr) return nullptr;

        invertTree(root->left);
        invertTree(root->right);
        TreeNode* temp = root->left;
        root->left = root->right;
        root->right = temp;

        return root;
    }
};
```

### 404. Sum of Left Leaves

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\
Output: 24\
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [1]\
Output: 0
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
The problem was solved using recursion first chack the leaf node and than than check its left node or right node if bothe condition are true(leaf node + left leaf) than update global variable with leaf node val.

### Code

/**

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) {
            return 0;
        }

        int sum = 0;
        if (root->left && !root->left->left && !root->left->right) {
            sum += root->left->val; // Add the value of left leaf
        }

        // Recursively calculate the sum for left and right subtrees
        sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root->left);
        sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root->right);

        return sum;
    }
};
```
