This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]\
Output: 34\
Explanation: We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.


#### Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]\
Output: 64\
Explanation: We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.

### MY-Problem Explanation:
#### Intuition :
When i see the questions i didn't understand the problem but when i see the example and calculate the values i can clearly understand the problem. I whould say everyone first understand the problem is very importand.

#### Approach :
Its acually simple questions first find the two large value from the vector/array and than multiple it. And do same things for second step find two minimum value and than muiltiple it After that substract from biger number to smaller number.
```bash
  Easy level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProductDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        int vsize = nums.size();
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int mulmax = nums[vsize-1]*nums[vsize-2];
        int mulmin = nums[0]*nums[1];
        return mulmax - mulmin;
        
    }
};
```

### 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]\
Output: [1,3,2]

#### Example 2:
Input: root = []\
Output: []

### MY-Problem Explanation:
#### Intuition :
Its Tree easy and basic travarsal.

#### Approach :
Using recursion it very much easy, Apply LHR rules for inorder traversal. LHR rules means first compelete left part(L) and than worrk head (H) part, after that call right(R) part.
```bash
  Easy level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void inorderTraver(vector<int> &v1, TreeNode* root){
        if(root == nullptr) return;
        inorderTraver(v1, root->left);
        v1.push_back(root->val);
        inorderTraver(v1, root->right);
    }
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int>v1;
        inorderTraver(v1, root);
        return v1;  
    }
};
```
