This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.

### Today i am completed 200 Questions on Leetcode

### 349. Intersection of Two Arrays - PODT

#### Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]\
Output: [2]


#### Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]\
Output: [9,4]\
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.

    vector<int> intersection(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        unordered_set<int> st1(begin(nums1), end(nums1));
        vector<int> result;
        for(int &num : nums2){
            if(st1.find(num) != st1.end()){
                result.push_back(num);
                st1.erase(num);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
