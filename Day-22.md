I am starting a 100-day LeetCode coding challenge. This journey is about consistency, determination, and self-improvement. Each day, I'll embrace a new coding problem, unravel its mysteries, and emerge as a stronger coder. It's not just about challenges; it's about pushing boundaries and becoming the best version of myself. With every line of code I write, I'll be one step closer to my goals. Let's embark on this remarkable journey together, because the adventure is in the coding, and the rewards await those who persevere. ☺️

### 2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number
#### Example 1:

Input: num = 4, t = 1\
Output: 6\
Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 6; it can become equal to num after performing this operation:
1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5. 
It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.

#### Example 2:
Input: num = 3, t = 2\
Output: 7\
Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 7; after performing these operations, x will equal num: 
1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 6 and num = 4.
2- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.
It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 7.
