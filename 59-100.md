This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum -XXXXX

#### Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3\
Output: 84\
Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]


#### Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], k = 4\
Output: 83

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumAfterPartitioning(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n=arr.size();
        vector<int> dp(n);
        int maxi=arr[0];
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
        {
            maxi=max(arr[i],maxi);
            dp[i]=(maxi*(i+1));
        }
        for(int i=k;i<n;i++)
        {
            dp[i]=arr[i]+dp[i-1];
            maxi=arr[i];
            //check if a partition can result into the maximum sum
            for(int j=i-1;j>i-k;j--)
            {
                //get the maximum element
                maxi=max(maxi,arr[j]);
                dp[i]=max(dp[i],dp[j-1]+ (i-j+1)*maxi);
            }
        }
        return dp[n-1];
    }
};
