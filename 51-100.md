This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int>& nums) {
        // support variables
        int len = nums.size();
        bool seen[len + 1];
        vector<int> res(2);
        // preparing seen
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) seen[i] = false;
        // parsing nums and finding the first part of res
        for (int i: nums) seen[i] = (!seen[i] || bool(1 + (res[0] = i)));
        // parsing seen and finding the second part of res
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) if (!seen[i]) return res[1] = i, res;
        return res;

    }
};
