This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List - PODT

#### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2\
Output: [1,2,3,5]


#### Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1\
Output: []
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
The idea came to mind quickly. Initially, count the total number of nodes in the linked list. Then, subtract 'n' from the total number of nodes. After that, proceed with the standard 'nth node deletion' function. There is an edge case to consider: if the total number of nodes is equal to 'n', simply return 'head->next'.

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        ListNode* temp = head;
        while(temp!=nullptr){
            count++;
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        if(count==n){
            return head->next;
        }
        ListNode* current = head;
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        int target = count-n;
        while(target!=0){
            prev = current;
            current = current->next;
            target--;
        }
        prev->next = current->next;
        delete current;
        return head;
    }
};
```
