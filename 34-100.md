This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.


### 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]\
Output: 3\
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2]\
Output: 1

#### Problem Explanation:
```bash
  There is three condition either diameter find in left node or either diameter find in right node. And final condition is left node hight + right node hight +1 (for root node).
  And than call recursive funcation.
```

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    int height(TreeNode* node){
        if(node == nullptr){
            return 0;
        }
        return max((height(node->left)), (height(node->right)))+1;
    }

    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==nullptr){
            return 0;
        }
        int op1 = diameterOfBinaryTree(root->left);
        int op2 = diameterOfBinaryTree(root->right);
        int op3 = height(root->left)+height(root->right);

        int ans = max(op1, max(op2, op3));
        return ans;
    }
};
```
