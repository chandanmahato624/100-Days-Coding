This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List

#### Example 1:

Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]\
Output: [13,8]\
Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.


#### Example 2:
Input: head = [1,1,1,1]\
Output: [1,1,1,1]\
Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Go with linear approach.
```bash
  Easy level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:

    ListNode* removeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        if(head and head->next){
            ListNode* newHead = removeNodes(head->next);
            if(newHead->val > head->val)return newHead;
            head->next = newHead;
        }
        return head;
    }
};
```
