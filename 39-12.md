This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.


### 234. Palindrome Linked List<font color="Red"> -Unwatched </font>

#### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]\
Output: true

#### Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]\
Output: false

```
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
        if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL){
            return (head);
        }
        ListNode *r_head = NULL;
        ListNode *ptr = head;
        while(ptr!=NULL){
            ListNode *temp = new ListNode(ptr->val);
            temp ->next = r_head;
            r_head = temp;
            ptr = ptr->next;
        }
        while(head && r_head){
            if(head->val != r_head->val){
                return false;
            }
            head = head->next;
            r_head = r_head->next;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
