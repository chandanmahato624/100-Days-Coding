This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.


### 110. Balanced Binary Tree

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\
Output: true

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]\
Output: false

#### MY-Problem Explanation:
 Check if left and right node are blanced or not, After that check the condition (left height - right height <=1) if three codition is true than return true or else return false. And then recursive call it again and again.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int height(TreeNode* node){
        if(node == nullptr){
            return 0;
        }
        return max((height(node->left)), (height(node->right)))+1;
    }
