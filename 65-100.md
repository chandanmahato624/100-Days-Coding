This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 876. Middle of the Linked List - PODT

#### Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]\
Output: [3,4,5]\
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.


#### Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\
Output: [4,5,6]\
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
When I first saw the questions, I understood that we need to determine how many nodes the linked list has. After that, we can simply divide it by 2 and run one more loop to find out the middle node.
```bash

```
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        int count = 0;
        ListNode* temp = head;
        while(temp!=nullptr){
            count++;
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        //int k=5;
        cout<<count;
        temp=head;
        for(int i=1; i<(count/2)+1; i++){
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        return temp;
    }
};
```

### 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

#### Example 1:
Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]\
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]\
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node. 


#### Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]\
Output: [1,2,4]\
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Find the middle->prev node and connect with middle next simple :).

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {
       ListNode* temp = head;
       if(temp->next==nullptr){
           return nullptr;
       }
       int count = 0;
       while(temp!=nullptr){
           count++;
           temp=temp->next;
       } 
       temp = head;
       for(int i=1; i<count/2; i++){
           temp=temp->next;
       }
       ListNode* tempExt = temp->next->next;
       temp->next=tempExt;
       return head;
    }
};
