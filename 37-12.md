This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.


### 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal<font color="Red"> -Unwatched </font>

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [1]\
Output: [[1]]

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        if(!root) return ans;
        q.push(root);
        int cnt;
        bool dir=1;
        while(!q.empty()){
            cnt = q.size();
            vector<int> tmp;
            while(cnt > 0){
                root = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if(root->left) q.push(root->left);
                if(root->right) q.push(root->right);
                tmp.push_back(root->val);
                cnt--;
            }
            ans.push_back(tmp);
            if(!dir) reverse(ans[ans.size()-1].begin(),ans[ans.size()-1].end());
            dir = !dir;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
