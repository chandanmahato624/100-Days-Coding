This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters -XXXXX

#### Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0\
Output: 4\
Explanation: The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.


#### Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]], target = 0\
Output: 5\
Explanation: The two 1x2 submatrices, plus the two 2x1 submatrices, plus the 2x2 submatrix.

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
       int numSubmatrixSumTarget(vector<vector<int>>& A, int target) {
        int res = 0, m = A.size(), n = A[0].size();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                A[i][j] += A[i][j - 1];

        unordered_map<int, int> counter;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                counter = {{0,1}};
                int cur = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
                    cur += A[k][j] - (i > 0 ? A[k][i - 1] : 0);
                    res += counter.find(cur - target) != counter.end() ? counter[cur - target] : 0;
                    counter[cur]++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
