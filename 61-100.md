This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

#### Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5\
Output: [4,1,9]\
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.


#### Example 2:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1\
Output: [4,5,9]\
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
It's an easy question but tricky. At first, I thought it wasn't possible to delete a given node without knowing its head, but then I realized that if I swap the node value without disturbing the structure, then it's possible.
```bash
  Medium level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        node->val=node->next->val;
        node->next=node->next->next;
    }
};
```

### 977. Squares of a Sorted Array - PODT

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]\
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]\
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].


#### Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]\
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]\
### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
No need to think that much because its a very easy question just squer each elements and after that sorting the vector.
```bash
  Easy level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> newNums;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            newNums.push_back(nums[i]*nums[i]);
        }
        sort(newNums.begin(), newNums.end());
        return newNums;
    }
};
```
