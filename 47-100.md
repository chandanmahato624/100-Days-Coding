This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions - PODT

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]\
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]\
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:\
- 1,3,4,2\
- 1,3\
- 1\
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.


#### Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]\
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]\
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
----------------
```bash
  Medium level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findMatrix(vector<int>& v) {
       unordered_map<int, int> um;
        for (auto &i : v){
            um[i]++;
        }
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        while (!um.empty()) {
            vector<int> temp, toErase;
            for (auto &[f, s] : um) {
                temp.emplace_back(f);
                s--;
                if (s == 0)toErase.emplace_back(f);
            }
            ans.emplace_back(temp);
            for (auto &i : toErase){
                um.erase(i);
            }
        }
        return ans;

    }
};
```

### 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]\
Output: [3,2,1]


#### Example 2:
Input: root = []\
Output: []

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
----------------
```bash
  Easy level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
void postorder(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& nodes) {
        if (!root) {
            return;
        }
        postorder(root -> left, nodes);
        postorder(root -> right, nodes);
        nodes.push_back(root -> val);
}
    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> nodes;
        postorder(root, nodes);
        return nodes;
        
    }
};
