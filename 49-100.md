This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 258. Add Digits

#### Example 1:

Input: num = 38\
Output: 2\
Explanation: The process is\
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11\
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 \
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.


#### Example 2:
Input: num = 0\
Output: 0

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
- Its a very easy question just create a funcation for digitSum and call again and again while ans<10;
```bash
  East level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int sumret(int n){
    int ans =0;
        while(n!=0){
            ans+=n%10;
            n=n/10;
        }
        return ans;
}
int addDigits(int num) {
        if(num==0)
            return 0;
        int anss = sumret(num);
        while(anss>9){
            anss = sumret(anss);
        }
        return anss;
}
};
```
