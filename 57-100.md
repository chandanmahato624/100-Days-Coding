This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference -XXXXX

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2\
Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]\
Explanation: We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1,1,3], [3,4,5] and [7,8,9].
The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.
Note that the order of elements is not important.


#### Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3\
Output: []\
Explanation: It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> divideArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int size = nums.size();
        

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        vector<vector<int>> result(size / 3, vector<int>(3));
        int groupIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 3) {
            if (i + 2 < size && nums[i + 2] - nums[i] <= k) {
                result[groupIndex] = { nums[i], nums[i + 1], nums[i + 2] };
                groupIndex++;
            }
            else {
                return vector<vector<int>>();
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
