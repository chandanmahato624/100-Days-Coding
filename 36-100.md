This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.


### 100. Same Tree

#### Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]\
Output: true

#### Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]\
Output: false

#### MY-Problem Explanation:

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if((p==nullptr) && (q==nullptr))return true;
        if(p==nullptr && q!=nullptr)return false;
        if(p!=nullptr && q==nullptr)return false;

        bool left = isSameTree(p->left,q->left);
        bool right = isSameTree(p->right,q->right);
        bool value = p->val == q->val;

        if(left && right && value){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```
