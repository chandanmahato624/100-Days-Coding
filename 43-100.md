This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

#### Example 1:

Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]\
Output: 1\
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.


#### Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]\
Output: 3.

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Find maximum diffarence between width. 
```bash
  Medium level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        int res=0;
        sort(begin(points), end(points));
        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
            if(res<points[i+1][0]-points[i][0]){
                res = points[i+1][0]-points[i][0];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### 2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List

#### Example 1:

Input: head = [18,6,10,3]\
Output: [18,6,6,2,10,1,3]\
Explanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2nd diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes (nodes in blue are the inserted nodes).\
- We insert the greatest common divisor of 18 and 6 = 6 between the 1st and the 2nd nodes.\
- We insert the greatest common divisor of 6 and 10 = 2 between the 2nd and the 3rd nodes.\
- We insert the greatest common divisor of 10 and 3 = 1 between the 3rd and the 4th nodes.\
There are no more adjacent nodes, so we return the linked list.

#### Example 2:
Input: head = [7]\
Output: [7]\
Explanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2nd diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes.\
There are no pairs of adjacent nodes, so we return the initial linked list.

 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* insertGreatestCommonDivisors(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* ptr = head;
    while(ptr->next){
        ListNode* temp = new ListNode(__gcd(ptr->val, ptr->next->val),  ptr->next);
        ptr->next = temp;
        ptr = temp->next;
    }
    return head;
    }
};
```
