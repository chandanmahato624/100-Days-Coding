This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 2706. Buy Two Chocolates = PODT

#### Example 1:

Input: prices = [1,2,2], money = 3\
Output: 0\
Explanation: Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0.


#### Example 2:
Input: prices = [3,2,3], money = 3\
Output: 3\
Explanation: You cannot buy 2 chocolates without going in debt, so we return 3.

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Its acually simple questions fiest u need to read problem carefuly than u can easyly understand what to do.\
THIS PROBLEM NO NEED TO EXPLAIN USE YOUR BRAIN. 
```bash

```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int buyChoco(vector<int>& prices, int money) {
        sort(prices.begin(), prices.end());
        int lwestsum = prices[0]+prices[1];
        int leftmoney = money - lwestsum;
        if(leftmoney<0){
            return money;
        } else{
            return leftmoney;
        }
    }
};

### 1302. Deepest Leaves Sum

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]\
Output: 15

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]\
Output: 19
### MY-Problem Explanation:
#### Intuition :
For beginners, I would suggest not to be scared if you come across medium-level questions. Sometimes, they are very easy. I am also a beginner, and I feel that what is written here resonates with my experience.
#### Approach :
First, you need to determine the depth of the tree, and this can be easily achieved by using recursion. Return the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1. Once you have obtained the depth of the tree, you can create a function to calculate the sum. In this function, when the depth value is 0 (or -1 when descending to a lower level), update the sum by adding the value of the current node (sum += node->val). Once you have completed these steps in your code, return the calculated sum to finish the implementation.

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int sum = 0;
    int lvlcount(TreeNode* root){
        if(root==nullptr) return 0;
       int count = max(lvlcount(root->left), lvlcount(root->right))+1;
       return count;
    }
    int sumdeep(int num, TreeNode* root){
        if(root==nullptr) return 0;
        if(num==1){
          sum=sum+root->val;
        }
        sumdeep(num-1, root->left);
        sumdeep(num-1, root->right);
        return sum;
    }
    int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int lvl = lvlcount(root);
        int sum = sumdeep(lvl, root);
        return sum;
    }
};
```

### 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]\
Output: 18\
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparent

#### Example 2:
Input: root = [1]\
Output: 0
### MY-Problem Explanation:
#### Intuition :
When I encountered the problem, a solution immediately came to mind because some time ago, I had solved a similar question (1302. Deepest Leaves Sum), and there seemed to be a pattern shared between the two problems. Although I initially considered approaching it differently, I couldn't think of an alternative method, so I decided to watch a YouTube video for a new perspective. Surprisingly, the approach in the video turned out to be more challenging than my original method. Consequently, I opted to stick with my initial approach and successfully solved the problem within 10 minutes.
#### Approach :
First create a global variable(If u think i do not decler it than also u can it) and than create a funcatin for returning grandchild sum(If i provide any node the funcation will claculate all grand child value and update to global variable).
And after that given funcation will do if the node value is even then send that node to written funcation for calculating values.

class Solution {
public:
    int sum = 0;
    void grndsum(int num, TreeNode* root){
        if(root==nullptr) return;
        if(num==3){
            sum=sum+root->val;
        }
        grndsum(num+1, root->left);
         grndsum(num+1, root->right);
    }
    int sumEvenGrandparent(TreeNode* root) {
         if(root==nullptr) return 0;
         if(root->val%2==0){
             grndsum(1, root);
         }
         sumEvenGrandparent(root->left);
         sumEvenGrandparent( root->right);
         return sum;
    }
};
