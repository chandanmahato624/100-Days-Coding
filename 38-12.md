This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.


### 5. Longest Palindromic Substring<font color="Red"> -Unwatched </font>

#### Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"\
Output: "bab"\
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

#### Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"\
Output: "bb"

#### MY-Problem Explanation:

```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
string ans = "";
    void expand(string &s , int left ,int right)
    {
        while(left >= 0 &&  right < s.size())
        {
            if(s[left] != s[right])
                break;
            left--,right++;
        }
        if(ans.size() < right - left )
            ans = s.substr(left + 1 , right - left - 1);
    }
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ; i++)
        {
            expand(s , i , i);
            expand(s , i , i+1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
