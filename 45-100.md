This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree

#### Example 1:

Input: root = [2,2,5,null,null,5,7]\
Output: 5\
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.


#### Example 2:
Input: root = [2,2,2]\
Output: -1\
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.

### MY-Problem Explanation:

#### Approach :
Go with linear approach.
```bash
  Easy level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

public:

    {
        if(!root)
            return;
        if(root->val > firstMin){
            if(root->val <= secondMin)
                secondMin = root->val;
        }
        findSecMin(root->left);
        findSecMin(root->right);
    }
    int findSecondMinimumValue(TreeNode* root) {
         firstMin = root->val;
        findSecMin(root);
        if(secondMin == LONG_MAX)
            return -1;
        return secondMin;
    }
};
