This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters -XXXXX

#### Example 1:

Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]\
Output: 4\
Explanation: All the valid concatenations are:
- ""
- "un"
- "iq"
- "ue"
- "uniq" ("un" + "iq")
- "ique" ("iq" + "ue")
Maximum length is 4.


#### Example 2:
Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]\
Output: 6\
Explanation: Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers").

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLength(vector<string>& A) {
        vector<bitset<26>> dp = {bitset<26>()};
        int res = 0;
        for (auto& s : A) {
            bitset<26> a;
            for (char c : s)
                a.set(c - 'a');
            int n = a.count();
            if (n < s.size()) continue;

            for (int i = dp.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
                bitset c = dp[i];
                if ((c & a).any()) continue;
                dp.push_back(c | a);
                res = max(res, (int)c.count() + n);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
