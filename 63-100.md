This journey isn't just about coding; it's a testament to consistency, determination, and relentless self-improvement. Every day, I delve into a new coding problem, unraveling its intricacies, and emerging as a more resilient coder.

But this challenge is more than just solving problems; it's about pushing boundaries and evolving into the best version of myself. With each line of code, I take a step closer to my goals. The adventure lies not just in the coding but in the growth it brings.

In my delayed repository, I've added a new section dedicated to explanations. Here, I break down the solutions, sharing insights, strategies, and the journey of unraveling each problem. It's not just about the answer; it's about understanding the why and how. Join me in this deeper exploration of code, where learning takes center stage.

I, CHANDAN, solemnly promise myself that from this day forward, I am dedicated to personal growth and improvement. I commit to solving at least three LeetCode problems each day, regardless of the challenges that may come my way. I embrace discipline as a guiding force in transforming myself into a better version. This promise is a commitment to continuous learning, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of self-improvement. I am determined, focused, and dedicated to this journey of growth. No matter what obstacles arise, I will persevere and evolve. This promise is a testament to my commitment to change and become the best version of myself.


### 948. Bag of Tokens - PODT  xxxxxxx xxx

#### Example 1:
Input: tokens = [100], power = 50

Output: 0

Explanation: Since your score is 0 initially, you cannot play the token face-down. You also cannot play it face-up since your power (50) is less than tokens[0] (100).


#### Example 2:
Input: tokens = [200,100], power = 150

Output: 1

Explanation: Play token1 (100) face-up, reducing your power to 50 and increasing your score to 1.

There is no need to play token0, since you cannot play it face-up to add to your score. The maximum score achievable is 1.

```bash
  Medium level coding questions
```
### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
public:
    /*
    Time Complexity: O(n*logn) // since we are using sorting
    Space Complexity: O(1) // we are not using any additional data structure here
    */
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& arr, int power) {
        int n = arr.size(); // extract size of array
        
        int score = 0; // intially we have score zero
        
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end()); // sort the array
        
        int i = 0, j = n - 1; // put two pointers on first and last
        
        // equal sign is not here, because for a single element,
        // we can't use it as to increase score and also use 
        // it as to increase power
        while(i < j) 
        {
            if(power >= arr[i]) // if we have available power to increase score, use it
            {
                power -= arr[i++];
                score++;
            }   
			                                                // for power to be gain, we should have at least one score
            else if(score >= 1 && power + arr[j] >= arr[i]) // and we have to make sure by gaining this power we are able to earn score
                                                           //  else it makes no point of spending score
            {
                power += arr[j--];
                score--;
            }
            else break; // because we already know that array is sorted,
			//so further values wil be definately in increasing order
        }
        
        while(i < j + 1 && power >= arr[i]) // when gap remains, then for that
        {
            power -= arr[i++];
            score++;
        }
        
        return score; // finally return score
    }
};
